## **How to use**

1. Add nodes by clicking anywhere on the canvas
2. For adding edges, click on source node followed by target node. (Order does not matter in case of undirected edges)
3. For adding weights to edges, click anywhere on the edge and type in the weight value

P.S.: Graph algorithms are currently being added to the list.
